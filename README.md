# Linked List in C

An example implementation of a linked list in C.

## Description

While trying to get familiar with pointers in C, it was suggested to me to try to implement a singly linked list.
This tiny program and library really helped me solidify many of the core concepts of C. This indirectly introduced
me to dynamic memory allocation, pointers to structures, and pointers to pointers. Before this project, it had never
occurred to me that pointers can be created without an associated variable, or that the variable doesn't need the
label that the programmer has attached to it for identification. Once I grasped that the 'values' are stored by 'type'
and 'location', and not by label, everything started to 'click'. I was finally starting to think about what is under
the abstraction of other languages.
